# JHS Gymnasium Rental Website

## Project Description
The JHS Gymnasium Rental Website is a modern, user-friendly platform designed to facilitate the booking and management of events at the JHS Gymnasium. It allows users to view upcoming events, book the venue for their own events, and access important venue information. The website features a visually appealing interface, interactive event carousel, and easy navigation to enhance the user experience.

## Significance of the Project

- **Transparency:** Provides clear event schedules and venue details, fostering trust and reliability.
- **Scalability:** The static site structure allows for easy updates and expansion as new events or features are added.

## Tech Stack Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages and content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design, ensuring the site looks professional on all devices.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive features such as the event carousel and dynamic navigation.
- **Font Awesome & Google Fonts:** For modern icons and typography, enhancing visual appeal.

### Why These Technologies?

- **Maintainability:** Code is easy to read, update, and extend for future features.
